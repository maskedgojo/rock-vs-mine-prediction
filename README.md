# Rock vs. Mine Prediction Using Machine Learning
=============================================

## Introduction
------------

This project focuses on predicting whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine using machine learning techniques. It leverages popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to provide an end-to-end solution for accurate classification. This classification task has significant applications in marine exploration and defense.

## Project Overview
-----------------

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and a carefully curated dataset, this project enables accurate predictions for real-world scenarios.

## Key Features
--------------

- **Data Collection and Processing**: The project involves collecting a dataset containing features related to underwater objects. Using Pandas, the collected data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: The project utilizes data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. By employing Matplotlib or Seaborn, visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices are created.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate the performance of the classification model accurately.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: The project uses logistic regression, a popular supervised learning algorithm, to build the classification model. Logistic regression is well-suited for binary classification tasks and offers interpretability.
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the logistic regression model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques like confusion matrices are employed to visualize the model's performance.

## Technologies Used
--------------------

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
